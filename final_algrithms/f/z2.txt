Assignment 1
Huffman Compression & Detl pssion
msertee required to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or detl pss the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressedol eompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elementstrh.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
BemeuC\ are dealing with sub probni we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recae through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Huffman Compression & Decompression
You are required to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-en .t sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recaively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub probixi sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort Ar…r]

s n 3mpression & Decompression
You are required to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n2 en .ts each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produoao. sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Huffman Compression & Decompression
riertee required to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The exeema-nmau-d1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or detl pss the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressedol eompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.

Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:

1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n2 en .ts each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produoao. sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
