Assignment 1
Huffman Compesion & Decompression
You are rerired to write a program that can compress
and decompgg  filuv tsdernefman encoding.
Input to this prot m is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompesed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconqr
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element seqnce to be sorted into
two subserences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subserences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valuccudtse
- we recurse through sub
problems to st A[p…r]

1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conrer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqaces to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because w re dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

kpeman Compression & Decompression
You are required to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compgper decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compge Cu Scempressed file.
2. The coduo k e code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conrer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqaces to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because w re dealing with sub problems we state the

it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conqr: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sted subserences to product
the sorted answer.

Because we are dling with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse thre--ub
problems to sort A[p…r]

The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively[
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqnces to product
the sorted answer.

Huffman Compression & Decompesion
YDteBelsired to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompgpp
e\ pee t
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the senf file.
3. The compesion ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively[
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqnces to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting aierithm based on divide and conrer.
Because we are dling with sub problems we state the

Thre3o sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge st.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

1. Merge Sort
The merge sort aierithm closely follows the divide-andconrer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element serence to be sorted into
two subseqaces of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: St the two subseqaces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valyc-n ts- we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Huffman Compression & Decompression
You are required to write a program that can compg  
and decompes a file using kpeman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort aierithm closely follows the divide-andconrer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element serence to be sorted into
two subseqaces of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: St the two subseqaces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valyc-n ts- we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element seqnce to be sorted into
two subserences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subserences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconqr
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element seqnce to be sorted into
two subserences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subserences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conrer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqaces to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because w re dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

You are required to write a program that can compg  
and decompes a file using kpeman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort aierithm closely follows the divide-andconrer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element serence to be sorted into
two subseqaces of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: St the two subseqaces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valyc-n ts- we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Huffman Compression & Decompression
You are required to write a program that can compg  
and decompes a file using kpeman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge sort aierithm closely follows the divide-andconrer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element serence to be sorted into
two subseqaces of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: St the two subseqaces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valyc-n ts- we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconqr
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element seqnce to be sorted into
two subserences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subserences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

1. Merge Sort
The merge st algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subseqnces of n=2 elements ch.
Conquer: Sort the two subseqnces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sted answer.
Merge St
A sorting algorithm based on divid nd conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=udhd
r=n but this vals change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

Huffman Compg qn & Decompression
You are reptred to write a program that can compress
and decompress a file using Huffman encoding.
Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compes or decompress the file.
Output of the program is:
1. The compesed/decompge 0oile.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.
1. Merge Sort
The merge st algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subseqnces of n=2 elements ch.
Conquer: Sort the two subseqnces recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sted answer.
Merge St
A sorting algorithm based on divid nd conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=udhd
r=n but this vals change as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]

The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conrer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subseqaces to product
the sorted answer.

A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values change as we recurse through sub

1. Merge Sort
Thre3o sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge st.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as folloat
Divide: Divide the n-element seqace to be sorted into
two subsequences of n=2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.

the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealing with sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this valyc-n ts- we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]
